          What we're doing to improve accessibility
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body"> We are constantly iterating and improving our services to make them as accessible as possible. However, we might have missed something, so please let us know if you find any accessibility issues.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">In early 2022 we commissioned a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 accessibility audit of the following website:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>report a rapid lateral flow test result</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">The audit was carried out by <a href="https://www.nomensa.com/"> Nomensa</a>, who are accessibility specialists. They looked at a selection of pages most likely to have accessibility concerns. The audit found some accessibility issues, which we have now fixed.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">We have also established accessibility processes, which we use as part of our ongoing work. These processes help us to design and develop accessible content whenever we make a change to any of our websites.

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">

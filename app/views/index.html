              <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to report your result to the NHS after using a rapid lateral flow test kit to check if you're infectious with coronavirus (COVID 19).</p>

                <div class="govuk-inset-text">
                  You cannot use this service to report results from a test kit you’ve paid for. If you paid for a test, check the test kit instructions to see if you should report your results to the private test provider.
                </div>

                <p>A rapid lateral flow test is a coronavirus test you do yourself. It shows you the result on a handheld device that comes with the test.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Report the result:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>every time you use a lateral flow test kit</li>
                  <li>as soon as possible after you get the result</li>
                  <li>no matter what it is - positive, negative or void</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body">If you are taking daily rapid lateral flow tests because you are a contact of someone who has COVID-19, you should report your result every day.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">You cannot report a result after more than 24 hours. You can only report one result at a time.</p>
